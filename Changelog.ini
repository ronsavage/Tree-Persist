Comments= <<EOT
- Add MIN_PERL_VERSION to Makefile.PL. Such a change is not worth a new release. Push to github.
- Some tests 'use t::test.pm', so for them add "use lib '.';" so when newer Perls default to
not having '.' in @INC, the code will still find t/tests.pm.
- Lower pre-req for Test::More to V 1.001002.
- Add t/00.*.
- Update Makefile.PL and POD to change RT to github.
- Change license in Makefile.PL from artistic_2 to perl.
1.13 2016-05-04T08;15:00
- Correct physical address of Free Software Foundation in LICENSE file. See RT#114149.
Thanx to Petr Pisar.

Date=2016-04-27T17:35:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No code changes.
- Adopt workflow techniques suggested by Kent Fredric. This means a cleaner workdir and a
much more reliable dist. The latter now has auto-generated MANIFEST and META.* files.

[V 1.11]
Date=2016-04-25T09:26:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No code changes.
- Add LICENSE file.
- Remove Build.PL.
- Update MANIFEST.SKIP.
- Add github repo to Makefile.PL and docs.
- Fix my licence (sic) mess so all references are to Perl. This involves edits to Makefile.PL
and LICENSE. See RT#113949. Thanx Kent Fredric.
- Fix Makefile.PL so modules only used for testing are in TEST_REQUIRES and not PREREQ_PM.
See RT#113948. Thanx Kent Fredric.
- Fix README so it more-or-less conforms to the Perl Foundation's guidelines at
http://www.perlfoundation.org/cpan_licensing_guidelines.

[V 1.10]
Date=2013-06-28T10:18:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Add DBD::SQLite to the pre-reqs. It is used for testing when $ENV{DBI_DSN} is not set.
Some CPAN Testers got syntax errors in the SQL used in t/load_from_db.t and t/save_to_db.t.
I assume this is because old versions of DBD::SQLite (i.e. SQLite) accepted:
insert into t (id, x) values (1, 2)
but not
insert into t (id, x) values (1, 2), (3, 4).
- Expand the FAQ slightly, regarding usage of DBD::SQLite.
- One CPAN Tester is still getting a 'Permission denied' error trying to unlink a temporary file.
I do not have a fix for this problem (yet).

[V 1.09]
Date=2013-06-26T16:05:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Replace File::Copy's copy with File::Slurp's write_file(), in yet another effort to fix these file
permission problems. Programs affected: t/associate_with_file.t and t/autocommit.t.
EOT

[V 1.08]
Date=2013-06-22T10:39:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Switch from File::Copy's cp() to its copy(), as a presumed fix for file permission problems copying
test files from t/datafiles to a temp dir.
EOT

[V 1.07]
Date=2013-06-21T15:35:00
Comments=- Patch tests to allow for CPAN testers who run with an un-writable temp dir.

[V 1.06]
Date=2013-06-20T11:53:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Replace Test::File::Cleaner with File::Temp because the t/ directory is read-only.
Now, a temp dir is used instead of trying and failing to write to t/.
EOT

[V 1.05]
Date=2013-06-17T17:13:00
Comments=- Update pre-reqs yet again.

[V 1.04]
Date=2013-06-13T12:50:00
Comments=- Add Module::Runtime to pre-reqs in Build.PL and Makefile.PL. This is a bad oversight on my part.

[V 1.03]
Date=2013-06-11T17:04:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Fix some tests which had stopped working.
- Implement user-specified class names for deflation/inflation of objects.
This was requested in a module review: http://cpanratings.perl.org/dist/Tree-Persist#10829.
The new code uses Module::Runtime.
This also means the 'type' parameter to connect() and create_datastore() is no longer mandatory.
Instead, a 'class' parameter can be used to supply the name of a deflator/inflator class.
See t/load_from_file.t and t/save_and_load.t for sample code.
- Replace UNIVERSAL::require with Module::Runtime in various modules.
- Update PODs.
- Rename test files from \d\d\d_*.t to *.t.
EOT

[V 1.02]
Date=2012-11-08T12:38:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No code changes.
- For pre-reqs such as strict, warnings, etc, which ship with Perl, set the version # to 0.
Reported as RT#80663 by Father Chrysostomos for Tree::DAG_Node.
- Add README.
EOT

[V 1.01]
Date=2012-10-04T10:27:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Ron Savage is now co-maint.
- Re-write MySQL-specific code, which is only used in the tests.
- Rename Changes to CHANGES.
- Use ini.report.pl (shipped with Module::Metadata::Changes) to add Changelog.ini to the distro.
- Reformat the dates in this file.
- Clean up the POD.
- Re-work Makefile.PL rather than have Build.PL generate it.
- Copy sub _strip_options() from Tree and add to Tree::Persist::Base. Then call it from within the
subs returned from _add_child_handler() and _remove_child_handler().
This resolves RT#61740, thereby allowing trees to be read in from a db and inserted into another
tree, and visa versa, i.e. allow trees to be inserted into a tree read in from a db.
- Add t/008_add_from_db.t to test this patch.
- Add an FAQ, whose first item explains using $ENV{DBI_DSN} etc to control the test database,
and that DBD::SQLite is used by default.
- Add code to File::Temp -> newdir(...) in tests to help run under BSD-based systems.
- Encode the 5 built-in XML character entities (within the node's value) when writing to an XML file.
They are decoded by XML::Parser when the file is read back in.
- Add scripts/xml.demo.pl and scripts/store.xml.
